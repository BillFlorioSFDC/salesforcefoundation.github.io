  title:          "Director of Product Development"
  bio:            "I've been working with nonprofits on the platform since 2007, and with the Foundation since 2010.  I'm continually impressed with what salesforce and the force.com platform can enable for that community..  I'm into building super functional apps with great APIs, enjoy spending time in the execute anonymous window, and have been known to write a meandering batch class or two when provoked."
