  bio:            "I've been working with nonprofits on the platform since 2007, and with the Foundation since 2010.  I'm continually impressed with what salesforce and the force.com platform can enable for that community. I'm into building super functional apps with great APIs, enjoy spending time in the execute anonymous window, and have been known to write a meandering batch class or two when provoked."

  bio:            "I am a long time web developer, primarily for nonprofits, and was thrilled to discover Salesforce and Force.com in 2011. My background includes a smattering of PHP, quite a bit of Python, and lots of Javascript. My favorite projects have three primary ingredients: good design, elegent code, and a good cause. I am also fond of prefixing classnames with 'Ry' and doing crazily awesome things with the JSON class in Apex, though the 'awesome' part is sometimes debatable."
